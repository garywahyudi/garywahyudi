# Gary Wahyudi--@garywahyudi
:wave: Welcome to my profile. I'm currently engaged in the study and application of DevSecOps, with a keen interest in the incorporation of security within the development and operations cycle. My side projects often reflect this focus, as I seek to develop practical solutions to real-world problems. Furthermore, I'm gaining experience in leveraging AWS to bolster infrastructure and improve security measures. I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement, looking forward to sharing my journey through the projects I undertake.
