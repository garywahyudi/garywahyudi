# Gary Wahyudi--@garywahyudi
:wave: Hi, I am an undergraduate student of [President University](https://president.ac.id/) currently majoring in Information Technology with a focus
on Website and Python related programming, which includes Responsive web designs, to making automation projects on my free time.

Here my github page serves a purpose of a portfolio to the personal projects I am going to make and also a place to store some of my GNU/Linux config files that
I have made during my free time, if any of it serves benefit for you please do so and use it.
